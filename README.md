# Fragments of Us

**Fragments of Us** is an immersive narrative-driven application designed to provide a safe and comforting experience for individuals dealing with family conflicts. Developed with a focus on emotional well-being and empathy, the app combines storytelling, interactive mechanics, and audiovisual elements to guide users through emotional reflection and healing.

🏆 **Winner of the Swift Student Challenge 2025**  
This project was proudly selected as one of the winners of Apple’s **Swift Student Challenge**, recognizing its creativity, technical implementation, and emotional impact.

## 🧠 Concept

The app invites users into the story of **Dora**, a girl facing emotional challenges at home. By experiencing her journey, users are encouraged to:

- Reflect on their own emotions  
- Understand complex family dynamics  
- Build resilience and self-awareness  
- Learn healthy ways to process feelings  

## 🎮 Gameplay Highlights

- **Narrative Choices**: Interact with Dora’s story through branching dialogues.  
- **Breathing Interaction**: A special button helps Dora (and the user) calm down after emotional moments.  
- **Drag & Drop Dialogues**: Choose responses by dragging dialogue options into place, simulating real-life communication.  
- **Puzzle Scene**: Reassemble Dora’s fragmented family photo at the beginning of the story to symbolically “piece things together.”
